# Loanlink Code Challenges

The 12traits Code Challenge is an opportunity to demonstrate proficiency with problem solving, collaboration skills, and curiosity we would expect you to demonstrate at Loanlink.

The challenge forms the foundation for further technical interviews as well as ideally onsite collaboration during your interview process.


## How to complete a Challenge
Select a challenge and create a new git repository for that project.
Organize your work within that repository. When you get to a stopping point, archive the repository (or publish it, if you prefer) and send it to your Loanlink contact.


#### Time
We want to be mindful of your time and would appreciate it if you spend no more than 6 hours on your challenge. The challenges are scoped for a ~4hr timeframe. We simply want to get a sense for your thought process and the way you work. If there are features you do not have time to implement, feel free to describe your intended implementation approach in the README.


#### Your Challenge README
Include the following in your README:

- A description of the problem and solution.
- The reasoning behind your technical decisions: trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you had additional time.
- How you would proceed and why.


#### Commit History
Use whatever development workflow works best for you. We just ask that you keep your commit history as clean as possible.

## What We Care About
Reviewing the application we'll look at the following aspects:

- **Clarity:** Does the README clearly explain the problem and solution?
- **Correctness:** Does the submission accomplish what was asked for? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
- **Code quality:** Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Is it aligned with the community-accepted way of solving similar problems?
- **Testing:** If required, what testing approach was taken? Will the tests be difficult to change if the requirements of the application changed?
- **Technical decisions:** Do choices of libraries, algorithms, and architecture seem appropriate for the challenge?
