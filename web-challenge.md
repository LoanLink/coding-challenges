# üç™ Loanlink Web Engineering Challenge

## Overview
Grandma wants to store all of her family recipes, but keeps losing her old recipe book. We're brinding grandma into the digital age by building her a web app where she can keep her recipes on the web!



### Requirements

Grandma isn't picky, there are only a few things she needs:

- [ ] Allow her add new receipes (If the page is refreshed, the saved recipes should persist)
- [ ] Allow her user edit an existing recipe
- [ ] Allow her to remove an existing recipe
- [ ] Provide an endpoint to list all saved recipes in JSON format _(We're not sure why grandma needs this one, but let's not question her)_

Because this is a prorotype for Grandma we don't need to be concerned with using a real database (it's ok if we lose data when the app shuts down) and she isn't very picky about how the app looks.



### Considerations

- How should the data be structured?
- How would you actually store data in the app?
- How would you deploy the app?
- What are you missing / what would you improve?
